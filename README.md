What is working on your project so far?
Thankfully, my script runs about 95% as expected. All functions operate as they should, as shown in my recording. "List", "Add", "Search", "Delete", and "Exit" all function as requested in the assignment

What are the current issues with your project?
I am recieving an error that my welcome message cannot be read. I attempted to change the function being used, but for some reason it makes the "List" function totally unusable. I am unsure of the corelation between these two, but feel as though the "List" function should take priority over the welcome message.

Which part of the project you plan to work on next?
The only thing remaining for my submission is getting my welcome screen text to work. I am unsure of how to fix this issue but will keep trying. Thankfully, everything else operates as expected. I wanted to have a project submitted before the deadline, but will try to fix this error in the meantime and upload my submission
